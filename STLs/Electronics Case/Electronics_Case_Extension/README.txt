Parts used to move the electronics case away from the frame of the printer by around 20mm for added clearance needed for wiring. Please ensure that you maintain a ground connection between the frame and the electronics case with this modification since they are no longer in direct electrical contact and the power supply is mounted to the case.

All parts should fit on a Mini-sized bed plate aside from "upper_full_length", which is not required but does result in a nicer finish.
